# Roll20 Macro Generator

This scripts fetches an url from the dandwiki.com (great site btw) and converts the information there to a roll20-macro. There are some TODO's left but its already pretty good for most spells.

## TODO

* convert dice-rolls and level dependent stuff to auto-calulated values
* change the notes from the summary to the (shortened) description
* decide how to handle the clerics "domains"
* compare the wiki information with the Player's Handbook

## Spell-Status

* Sorcerer: few basic spells, unchecked
* Cleric: few basic spells, unchecked
* Ranger: complete, unchecked
